      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer and synthetic biologist with a firm belief in building from first principles . I&amp;rsquo;m trying to develop systems and tools to engineer living systems from scratch.
I study Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, and Bioengineering at Berkeley.
My interests vary, but I&amp;rsquo;m currently reading generally about or working on projects relating to:
 Distributed computing Cortical Micro-circuits  Evolutionary Biology Computer networking Microservice infrastructure (mostly K8s) early 1800s American history Brain-Computer Interfaces  A reading list from the past few months:</description>
