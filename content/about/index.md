I'm a full stack software engineer and synthetic biologist with a firm belief in building from [first
principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle) using [lean
methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup), and a student of
Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, and Bioengineering at Berkeley.
 
I'm interested in developing systems and tools to engineer living systems from
scratch. Such work lies at the crossroads of automation, computational biology,
software engineering, and applied mathematics. I'm a proponent of
interdisciplinary thought and merging siloed fields of academia to make things
that work.
