I'm a software engineer and synthetic biologist with a firm belief in
building from [first principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle).
I'm trying to develop systems and tools to engineer living systems from
scratch. 

I study Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, and Bioengineering at
Berkeley.

My interests vary, but I'm currently reading generally about or working on projects relating to:

  * Distributed computing
  * [Cortical Micro-circuits](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000532)
  * Evolutionary Biology
  * Computer networking
  * Microservice infrastructure (mostly K8s)
  * early 1800s American history
  * Brain-Computer Interfaces

A reading list from the past few months:

  * [Science since Babylon](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3410541-science-since-babylon)
  * [Necessary Illusions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necessary_Illusions)
  * [From Bacteria to Bach and Back](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_Bacteria_to_Bach_and_Back)
  * [Godel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach)
  * [Domain-Driven Design](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/179133.Domain_Driven_Design)
  * [The Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42403122-the-code)
  * [The First Tycoon](sttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_First_Tycoon)
